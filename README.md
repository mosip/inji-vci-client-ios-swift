                                    credentialType: CREDENTIAL_TYPES,
                                    credentialFormat: .ldp_vc)
```
2. Format: `mso_mdoc`

let issuerMeta = IssuerMeta(credentialAudience: CREDENTIAL_AUDIENCE,
                            credentialEndpoint: CREDENTIAL_ENDPOINT,

                            claims: CLAIMS)
```

###### Exceptions

1. DownloadFailedError is thrown when the credential issuer did not respond with credential response
2. NetworkRequestTimeOutError is thrown when the request is timedout
